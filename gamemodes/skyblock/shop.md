## <mark style="color:purple;">Crops</mark>

In the crops category, you can sell any farmable crops on the server. Each crop has a specific price based on its rarity and farming difficulty. You can also increase the base price of a crop by leveling up your island [<mark style="color:purple;">crop mastery</mark>](island/crop-mastery.md) for that specific crop.
