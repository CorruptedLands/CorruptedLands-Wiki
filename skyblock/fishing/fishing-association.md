# üê° Fishing Association

## <mark style="color:purple;">Fishing Shop</mark>

You can access the fishing shop through the NPC "Edward." Each fish has a unique selling price based on its [<mark style="color:purple;">rarity</mark>](fish.md#fish-items). The shop uses a bucket system: if you don‚Äôt have a specific [<mark style="color:purple;">fish</mark>](fish.md#fish-items), its icon remains hidden. Once you have in your inventory any [<mark style="color:purple;">fish</mark>](fish.md#fish-items), its icon will appear, allowing you to click on it and sell it.

Each time you use the Sell All option with x5 fish, you'll receive an additional 0.1% multiplier as a bonus.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Edward's Mariner Market</mark>

At Edward's Mariner Market, you‚Äôll find a variety of useful items like bait to enhance your fishing experience, as well as unique items you can trade fish for, such as fishing rods and other special items.
