# üê° Fishing Association

## <mark style="color:purple;">Fishing Shop</mark>

You can access the fishing shop through the NPC "Edward." Each fish has a unique selling price based on its [<mark style="color:purple;">rarity</mark>](fish.md#fish-items). The shop uses a bucket system: if you don‚Äôt have a specific fish, its icon remains hidden. Once you have in your inventory any fish, its icon will appear, allowing you to click on it and sell it.
